Feature: Handle pipeline misconfiguration and failures

  Scenario: Initialize OCR Filter with invalid engine
    Given an OCR filter configuration with an invalid engine
    When the OCR filter is initialized
    Then it should raise a ValueError

  Scenario: Execute pipeline with missing video file
    Given a configuration with a non-existent video file path
    When the pipeline is executed
    Then it should raise a FileNotFoundError

  Scenario: Execute pipeline with missing outputs
    Given a pipeline configuration without defined outputs
    When the pipeline is executed
    Then it should log a configuration error and not crash

  Feature: Measure OCR pipeline performance

Scenario: Measure pipeline execution time under normal load
  Given the pipeline is executed with a small video file
  When the pipeline finishes
  Then the execution time should be below 10 seconds

Scenario: Measure memory usage of OCR pipeline
  Given the pipeline is run with memory profiling enabled
  When the pipeline finishes
  Then the memory usage should not exceed 300MB
